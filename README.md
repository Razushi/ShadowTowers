# Trials of Shadows
A minecraft mod that's gonna create the gameplay loop that Trial Chamber really should have been. 

## Introduces a new mechanic to get you into a repeatable dungeon and actually rewards you with loot + doesn't clog up the overworld + doesn't need to afk and mine for 283 hours to stumble upon. Dungeons are repeatable. |

You can 'visit' past dungeons cleared (created from a tileset design.)
Coop with your friends (Hopefully.) 
Explore interesting architecture? (What's so interesting?)
Fight.

Did I mention it's a dungeon? Yes, I mean the combat kind. 

## Things for me on the todo list:
- Wikihow on how to make a minecraft mod.
- Make the minecraft mod.
- Sleep?
- Release the minecraft mod.
