A minecraft mod that's gonna create the gameplay loop that Trial Chamber really should have been. 

Introduces a new mechanic to get you into a repeatable dungeon and actually rewards you with loot + doesn't clog up the overworld + doesn't need to afk and mine for 283 hours to stumble upon. Dungeons are repeatable. You can 'visit' past dungeons cleared, created from a tileset design. 
Lets you coop with your friends (Hopefully.) 

Things to do:
- Wikihow on how to make a minecraft mod.
- Make the minecraft mod.
- Sleep?
- Release the minecraft mod.
